<h2> Title: <b> Analyze Products Based on User Reviews & Ratings! 🚀🔍📊💯 </b></h2>

**Description:** Are you struggling to find the best products among a sea of options? Look no further! My Product Analysis project, powered by #StanfordCoreNLP, #SeleniumWebDriver, #TestNG, and #Java, is here to help you make informed decisions by analyzing user reviews and ratings. 🌟🔎

I have conducted a comprehensive analysis of Amazon products based on user reviews and ratings. Utilizing Java Selenium and TestNG to automate the data collection process and Stanford CoreNLP for advanced natural language processing. 📈💬🔬

By analyzing both user reviews and ratings, I was able to gain a deeper understanding of customer preferences, pain points, and overall satisfaction levels. I examined various aspects of product features, customer sentiment, and overall product ratings to gain a detailed understanding of the key factors that drive product success on Amazon. 📋🤔⭐

🔥 With my user-friendly project, you can easily determine the quality of products. Rest assured, it fully complies with Amazon's terms and conditions. We understand the importance of adhering to Amazon's guidelines, as they strictly prohibit bots and automated tools. Our project takes all necessary precautions to ensure compliance. ✔️🤖

To prioritize your Instagram account's safety, my project includes built-in safeguards such as random delays, limitations on daily actions, and other compliance features. ⏱️🛡️

Note: To safeguard sensitive information, my Amazon automation project stores data in the confing.properties file. By separating this information from the main codebase, we minimize the risk of data breaches or security issues. 🚫👨‍💻 If you have any questions or concerns about data storage and usage, please feel free to reach out.
